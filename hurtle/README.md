To run the Slime simulation, do stack run in the terminal, followed by the path to a hogo file that you want to
run.
Example:
#stack run <…>/hurtle/passing/working3.hogo
I chose to do a slime simulation as I had read about it and was interested in implementing it.
The slime model that I based my program off is linked here:

I took some creative liberties in my implementation, but it is inspired by the program described in the paper.
I really enjoyed writing this slime simulation. I think it really clarified a lot of things with Haskell. The parser
especially I think helped me understand monads so that’s nice.
